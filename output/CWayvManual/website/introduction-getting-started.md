## 1.2 Getting Started

The following program in C~, prints "Hello World" after being compiled and run:

```haxe
class Main {
  public function Main():Void {
    Debug.fTrace("Hello World");
  }
}
```

This can be easily tested  by saving the above code to a file named `Main.cw` and invoking the Cwc Compiler
